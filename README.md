# Project Euler

These are some of my solutions to the problems hosted at [projecteuler.net](http://www.projecteuler.net).

At the moment I'm intending to use these to practice using C (I've already done many of the problems before in a variety of different languages), although I might change my mind about that as and when I feel like experimenting!

You should try not to look at the solutions until you've solved the problems yourself, or else there's no benefit :)
